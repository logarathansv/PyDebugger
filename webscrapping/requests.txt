Security

Fixed an issue where setting verify=False on the first request from a
Session will cause subsequent requests to the same origin to also ignore
cert verification, regardless of the value of verify.
(GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56)
Improvements

verify=True now reuses a global SSLContext which should improve
request time variance between first and subsequent requests. It should
also minimize certificate load time on Windows systems when using a Python
version built with OpenSSL 3.x. (#6667)
Requests now supports optional use of character detection
(chardet or charset_normalizer) when repackaged or vendored.
This enables pip and other projects to minimize their vendoring
surface area. The Response.text() and apparent_encoding APIs
will default to utf-8 if neither library is present. (#6702)
Bugfixes

Fixed bug in length detection where emoji length was incorrectly
calculated in the request content-length. (#6589)
Fixed deserialization bug in JSONDecodeError. (#6629)
Fixed bug where an extra leading / (path separator) could lead
urllib3 to unnecessarily reparse the request URI. (#6644)
