Page: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.eval.html#pandas.eval
pandas.eval # pandas. eval ( expr , parser = 'pandas' , engine = None , local_dict = None , global_dict = None , resolvers = () , level = 0 , target = None , inplace = False ) [source] # Evaluate a Python expression as a string using various backends. The following arithmetic operations are supported: + , - , * , / , ** , % , // (python engine only) along with the following
boolean operations: | (or), & (and), and ~ (not).
Additionally, the 'pandas' parser allows the use of and , or , and not with the same semantics as the
corresponding bitwise operators. Series and DataFrame objects are supported and behave as they would
with plain olâ Python evaluation. Parameters : expr str The expression to evaluate. This string cannot contain any Python statements ,
only Python expressions . parser {âpandasâ, âpythonâ}, default âpandasâ The parser to use to construct the syntax tree from the expression. The
default of 'pandas' parses code slightly different than standard
Python. Alternatively, you can parse an expression using the 'python' parser to retain strict Python semantics.  See the enhancing performance documentation for
more details. engine {âpythonâ, ânumexprâ}, default ânumexprâ The engine used to evaluate the expression. Supported engines are None : tries to use numexpr , falls back to python 'numexpr' : This default engine evaluates pandas objects using
numexpr for large speed ups in complex expressions with large frames. 'python' : Performs operations as if you had eval âd in top
level python. This engine is generally not that useful. More backends may be available in the future. local_dict dict or None, optional A dictionary of local variables, taken from locals() by default. global_dict dict or None, optional A dictionary of global variables, taken from globals() by default. resolvers list of dict-like or None, optional A list of objects implementing the __getitem__ special method that
you can use to inject an additional collection of namespaces to use for
variable lookup. For example, this is used in the query() method to inject the DataFrame.index and DataFrame.columns variables that refer to their respective DataFrame instance attributes. level int, optional The number of prior stack frames to traverse and add to the current
scope. Most users will not need to change this parameter. target object, optional, default None This is the target object for assignment. It is used when there is
variable assignment in the expression. If so, then target must
support item assignment with string keys, and if a copy is being
returned, it must also support .copy() . inplace bool, default False If target is provided, and the expression mutates target , whether
to modify target inplace. Otherwise, return a copy of target with
the mutation. Returns : ndarray, numeric scalar, DataFrame, Series, or None The completion value of evaluating the given code or None if inplace=True . Raises : ValueError There are many instances where such an error can be raised: target=None , but the expression is multiline. The expression is multiline, but not all them have item assignment.
An example of such an arrangement is this: a = b + 1
a + 2 Here, there are expressions on different lines, making it multiline,
but the last line has no variable assigned to the output of a + 2 . inplace=True , but the expression is missing item assignment. Item assignment is provided, but the target does not support
string item assignment. Item assignment is provided and inplace=False , but the target does not support the .copy() method See also DataFrame.query Evaluates a boolean expression to query the columns of a frame. DataFrame.eval Evaluate a string describing operations on DataFrame columns. Notes The dtype of any objects involved in an arithmetic % operation are
recursively cast to float64 . See the enhancing performance documentation for
more details. Examples >>> df = pd . DataFrame ({ "animal" : [ "dog" , "pig" ], "age" : [ 10 , 20 ]}) >>> df animal  age 0    dog   10 1    pig   20 We can add a new column using pd.eval : >>> pd . eval ( "double_age = df.age * 2" , target = df ) animal  age  double_age 0    dog   10          20 1    pig   20          40
